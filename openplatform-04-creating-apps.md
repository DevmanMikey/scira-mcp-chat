It's very easy to create OpenPlatform application. __Follow this__ [source-code: __TestApp__](https://github.com/totaljs/openplatform-application).

## Domain name

Each OpenPlatform's application needs to have own domain name. Of course, for testing you can use local IP address in the form e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8001`, etc.. Important step is to have `openplatform.json` with meta data of this application. This file needs to be stored in application's root available on e.g. `http//127.0.0.1:8001/openplatform.json`.

__IMPORTANT__: you can use different domain names or second domain level.

## Register your application

Run the OpenPlatform and __then register__ your app in Control Panel section (you need to have SuperAdmin privileges).
